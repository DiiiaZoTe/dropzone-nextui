Built to be integrated to [NextUI](https://nextui.org).
Use at your own risk... not production tested.  
Code is a mess, sorry not sorry.

Dep needed:  
``npm i @formkit/auto-animate react-dropzone``

This can surely be optimized.  
When ran, index will display some of the option to modify for you to preview how the dropzone looks.
